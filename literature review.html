        <h3>METHODOLOGY:</h3>
        <p>For implementing Automatic Street Lighting, this paper involves method which is a combination of sensor-based control, microcontroller automation, wireless communication, and power optimization to create a smart street lighting system. These methods improve efficiency, reduce operational costs, and make urban infrastructure more sustainable. </p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Sensors used here to build automatic street lighting system are </li>
            <br>
        <ol start="a" type="a">
            <li><b>Light Dependent Resistor (LDR):</b> It Measures ambient light levels. If the intensity drops below a threshold (e.g., evening time), the lights turn on.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>PIR (Passive Infrared) Sensors: </b>Detects motion of pedestrians or vehicles. If motion is detected, the lights turn on; otherwise, they remain off or dimmed to save energy</li>
            <br>
        </ol>
        <li>	A microcontroller (such as an Arduino) processes data from the LDR and PIR sensors. It makes the decisions to turn lights on or off based on sensor inputs, eliminating the need for manual operation. The microcontroller also controls dimming to reduce power consumption when no movement is detected.</li>
        <br>
        <li>The system uses a wireless sensor network (WSN) to connect streetlights and enable remote control. Each streetlight node communicates with others to optimize lighting across an entire area. This ensures that if motion is detected at one point, the adjacent lights may also turn on to improve visibility.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>When the LDR detects low light levels, the system prepares to turn on the light</li>
            <br>
            <li>If the PIR sensor detects human motion, the light is turned on.</li>
            <br>
            <li>If no motion is detected for a set time, the light turns off to save energy</li>
            <br>
            <li>The system is programmed using the Arduino IDE, and code execution is based on sensor inputs</li>
            <br>
            <li>The system was tested using Tinkercad, an online simulation tool</li>
            <br>
            <li>Various scenarios were evaluated to measure sensor response, accuracy, and energy efficiency</li>
